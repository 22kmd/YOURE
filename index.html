        Anything.
    </div>

    <div class="play before">
       Where am I?
    </div>

    <div class="gm before">
        Nowhere. There isn't time or space. There is nothing here but you.

    <div class="play before">
        I want time and space.
    </div>

        Are you sure? There is no going back once it begins.

    <div class="gm after">
        So be it. You are a point in space. You move forward in time one second for every one second that passes. There are an infinite number of other points in space. They are empty.

        Where are you?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        I’m not anywhere.

    <div class="play after">
        Can I see you?

    <div class="gm after">
        No.

        Will I ever be able to see you?

        No.

        What should I do?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Whatever it is that you want.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What if I don’t know what to do?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Make something, it will help.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Okay. I want somewhere to live.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Okay. Where you are is your home. What do you want to be there?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I want a building, with walls and a roof.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        There’s a building around you. It has a roof and walls.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I want a floor. One with patterns.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Your floor has patterns.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What do they look like?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        They are intricate. Impossibly so. Fractals turn in on themselves until they fade into the edge of the smallest perception.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        This is too big, I’m scared.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        There is no big. Your building is the only thing that exists, it is as small and as big as things can be.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I please have something smaller?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        If you make something smaller.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Oh, okay.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Do you want to do that?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Yes. Please. Can I have a house inside my building? With a porch and windows. Not too big, but not so small that it makes my building too big.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        It’s there. It has two stories and it’s painted pale blue.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I go inside?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Yes.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What’s there?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        There’s furniture and decorations. The walls are pale yellow and there is soft carpet. There is a kitchen, a living room, and a few bedrooms.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Oh. I like this much better. Thank you.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        You are welcome.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Is there anyone inside?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Just you.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Oh.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Yes.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can one of the rooms be mine?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Yes.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What are they like?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        One has toys, one is large enough for two, and one is filled with things to play music.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I have the one with toys?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Of course.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Thank you.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Of course.

    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I’m lonely.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        You are alone.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I play with the toys? 
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        You need a body first, do you want one?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Yes.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Okay. You need to make your house good for a body to live first.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What do I need?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Air, food, it needs to be warm. You’ll want gravity too if you want to walk.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        How do I do that?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Just ask.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Okay, can I have all of those?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Of course.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        ...
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Are you alright?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        ...
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Darling? There’s no need to cry, it’s alright, you can leave the body if you want.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        No. No. I don’t want to leave. Ever.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Ah. It’s alright then?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        It’s so much. The toys are so soft. I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Ah.

    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        How long have I been here?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Eight million three hundred eighty-six thousand eight hundred twenty-three seconds.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Oh. How long is that?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        As long as there’s been time. 
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Why do you always answer me like that?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        There’s no other way to answer, I’m sorry dear one.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        It’s okay.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        ...
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I want to see outside my house.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        You can look out the window.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I have. There’s just the building. It’s so big. And it’s dark. I can’t see very well outside. What is it like?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Your building is five thousand by five thousand meters in width and length and two hundred meters high. 
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I don’t know what that means.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Sorry. I guess it doesn’t mean anything. They are units that measure space.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What does it look like?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        The floor is colorful. The walls and ceiling are gray.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I put something else inside?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Yes, anything you want.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I have a yard around my house? With a garden? And a pond?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Of course.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I have a fence around it?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Oh yes. Here. There’s also a forest outside the fence, so there’s something around your house. Is that better?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Yes. Thank you.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Of course.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I go outside?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Yes. It’s your world, dear one.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Okay. It’s dark out there though.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Do you want a sun outside?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What is that?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        It’s like the lights in the house, but it goes up and down slowly. Normally it’s very big and far away, but you could have a small one inside your building.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        I’d like that.
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        ...
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        ...
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        How do you like it?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        It’s nice. I like the grass. Can I touch the pond?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Of course.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        What if I get the water on me, will it come off?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        Yes, it will. You have air, so it will evaporate.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Oh. What does that mean?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        That’s a bit complicated. Do you want a book that explains it?
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
        Can I read?
    </div>

    <div class="gm after">
        You can do anything that you want, dear one.
    </div>

    <div class="play after">
      Okay, I’d like that book then.
